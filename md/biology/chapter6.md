# Chapter 6: Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration

# Overview

### Life Chemical Energy

Life requires energy.

Energy is often stored in chemical bonds: energy is used to create a chemical bond and is then stored in the bond. To release the energy, the bond is broken.

**Metabolism:** The totality of all chemical reactions in an organism

Energy is often transferred through the transfer of high-energy electrons

**Redox reaction:** Reaction in which one molecule gains an electron and one loses

- **Oxidation reaction:** Reaction in which a molecule loses an electron
- **Reduction reaction:** Reaction in which a molecule gains an electron

### Circle of Life Energy

Life on earth obtains energy from the sun.

**Photosynthesis:** Cells use energy from the sun to create glucose, storing the energy in the glucose

- Overview: Takes $H_2O$ and $CO_2$; creates $C_6H_{12}O_6$ (glucose), releases $O_2$
- Process:
    - $H_2O$ is split
    - The oxygen from the $H_2O$ is released as a byproduct
    - Energy from the sun fuses the hydrogen with $CO_2$, making glucose

**Cellular Respiration:** Cells breaks down glucose and uses the released energy to make ATP, which is used as the cellular “energy currency”

- Overview: Takes $C_6H{12}O_6$ (glucose) and $O_2$; creates ATP, releases $CO_2$ and $H_2O$
- Process:
    - The hydrogen is broken from the $C_6H_{12}O_6$
    - The carbon and oxygen are released as a $CO_2$ byproduct
    - The energy released by breaking the hydrogen from the glucose is used to make ATP
    - The hydrogen is then removed with oxygen as $H_2O$

### ATP

**ATP (Adenosine triphosphate):** Contains three phosphate groups

**ADP (Adenosine diphosphate):** Contains two phosphate groups

ATP energy:

- Cells “charge” ATP by using energy to fuse a third phosphate group to ADP, turning it into ATP and storing the energy in the bond with the added phosphate group
- **Phosphorylation:** Adding a phosphate group to a molecule
- To use the energy, the bond with the third phosphate group is broken, releasing its stored energy, which the cell can use to power cellular processes
- The ADP and lone phosphate group can then be refused and reused

### Trophic Categories

Cells break down glucose to make ATP, and use the ATP as “energy currency”.

**Autotrophs:** Make their own glucose

- **Phototroph:** Uses energy from the sun to make glucose; photosynthesis
    - Includes plants and select other organisms
- **Chemiotroph:** Uses energy from the breakdown of other chemicals to make glucose

**Heterotrophs:** Obtain glucose by eating other organisms

- Includes animals

# Photosynthesis

### Overview

- Equation:
    
    $$
    \text{Sunlight} + \text{CO} _2 + \text{H} _2 \text{O} \rarr \text{Glucose} + \text{O} _2
    $$
    
- Photosynthesis takes $CO_2$ and $H_2O$, makes glucose, and releases $O_2$
    - The $CO_2$ enters the plant, and the $O_2$ exits the plant, through **stomata** pores
    - $H_2O$ is absorbed into the plant through its roots
- Photosynthesis has two stages:
    - **Light dependent reaction:** Stores energy from the sun in temporary energy-storing molecules
    - **Light independent reaction:** Uses the energy in the temporary energy-storing molecules to make glucose from the hydrogen and $CO_2$

### Chloroplasts

**Chloroplast:** Organelle in which photosynthesis takes place

- Contains a double outer membrane
- **Thylakoids:** Disc-like structure within choloroplasts
    - **Chlorophyll:** Pigments within the thylakoid membrane; absorb sunlight
        - Does not absorb green wavelength sunlight, instead reflects it, resulting in a green appearance
    - **Thylakoid lumen:** Within the thylakoid membrane
- **Granum** (plural: grana)**:** Stack of thylakoids
- **Stroma:** Space inside chloroplast not occupied by thylakoids, filled with fluid
- Also has its own DNA and ribosome

### Light Dependent Reaction

1. **Photosystem II (PSII)**
    - Chlorophyll within **PSII** - ****a protein structure in the thylakoid membrane - absorb sunlight, exciting electrons
    - The excited electrons move to the **primary electron acceptor** in the center of the photosystem
    - The electrons go on to make ATP and join high-energy electron acceptors, which are used to make glucose
    - $H_2O$ is broken to oxygen, $H^+$ protons, and electrons - **photolysis**; the electrons from $H_2O$ replace the electrons in the chlorophyll, the protons are used for the proton gradient to manufacture ATP and are eventually fused with the $CO_2$ to make glucose.
2. **Electron Transport Chain (ETC)**
    - The excited electron moves from the primary electron acceptor to the **ETC** - a series of proteins within the thylakoid membrane
    - These proteins use the energy from the electron to pump protons from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen. This proton gradient will eventually be used to make ATP.
    - The electron goes from the ETC to PSI.
3. **Photosystem I (PSI)**
    - **PSI** is another protein structure in the thylakoid membrane containing chlorophyl
    - In PSI, the electron is re-energized
    - The electron then moves to the second and final ETC
4. **ETC 2**
    - In the second ETC, NADP+ is reduced to NADPH, a **high energy electron carrier**
    - The NADP+ accepts two high energy electrons, as well as a proton, turning it into NADPH
    - NADPH advances to the light independent reaction and assists in the Calvin cycle. The hydrogen proton and electrons which are added to the CO2 come from the NADPH.
5. **ATP Synthase**
    - The proton gradient in the thylakoid lumen created by the first ETC is used to manufacture ATP
    - Protons are diffused through **ATP Synthase** - a enzyme in the thylakoid membrane
    - This diffusion powers the ATP synthase’s manufacturing of ATP
    - **Chemiosmosis:** Using a chemical gradient’s diffusion to power a reaction
6. **Light Independent Reaction**
    - The NADPH from the ETC and the ATP from the ATP synthase advance to the light independent reaction, to manufacture glucose

### Light Independent Reaction

**Carbon Fixation:** Converting nonorganic carbon - carbon without hydrogen, such as $CO_2$ - to organic carbon, such as glucose

**Calvin Cycle:** Light independent reaction; does not directly use light - instead, uses ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reaction to perform carbon fixation

- Takes place in the stroma

Process:

- $CO_2$ is combined with a five carbon molecule, RuBP, by the RuBisCO enzyme
- This splits into two 3-PGA molecules molecules - each with three carbons
- ATP and NADPH turn each 3-PGA into G3P
- Most G3Ps remain, and are turned back into RuBP by ATP to be cycled again
- Some G3Ps then leave the chloroplast, and, in the cell cytoplasm, are made into glucose.

### C3, C4, CAM Plants

**C3:** Most plants are C3 plants, meaning, they use the C3 carbon fixation path.

- The C3 path is the path described above, in which the plant captures $CO_2$, and, during the Calvin cycle, directly performs carbon fixation, bonding the carbon with the RuBP and making the three-carbon 3-PGA
- However, this has a potential issue:
    - **Photorespiration:** If there is not enough $CO_2$ in the area where the Calvin Cycle is to take place, and there is a lot of oxygen, the Rubisco may bond oxygen, instead of $CO_2$, with the RuBP. This results in a net loss of energy and carbon and is highly inefficient.
    - In high temperature environments, plants close their stomata to avoid losing $H_2O$ to evaporation. However, this also blocks $CO_2$ from entering the cell, and $O_2$ from exiting the cell, which can lead to an oxygen build up, resulting in photorespiration.
- Some plants have techniques to avoid this issue:

**C4 Plants:** C4 plants use the C4 path

- In the C4 path, the plant captures carbon in close-to-surface **mesophyll** cells and forms 4-carbon molecules.
- The packed 4-carbon molecule then goes to inner-cell low-oxygen **bundle-sheath** cells, where the Calvin cycle takes place.
- This ensures a high carbon concentration in the bundle-sheath cell and avoids photorespiration.
    - Includes: Maize, sugarcane, grass

**CAM Plants:**

- CAM plants capture $CO_2$ at night and store the carbon in vacuoles.
- Then, during the day, when there is sunlight and the light dependent reaction takes place, it releases the carbon.
- This ensures an adequate supply of carbon during the day when the photosynthesis occurs even though its stomata is closed.
    - Includes: Pineapple, cactus, succulents

# Cellular Respiration

### Overview

- Equation:
    
    $$
    \text{Glucose} + \text{O} _2 \rarr \text{CO} _2 + \text{H} _2 \text{O} + \text{ATP}
    $$
    
- Cellular respiration takes glucose and oxygen; breaks down the glucose into $CO_2$ and hydrogen, releases the $CO_2$, uses the oxygen to collect the hydrogen and release $H_2O$, and uses the energy released from the glucose to create ATP.
- Cellular respiration takes place over many steps:
    - In the first few steps, it breaks down the glucose, creating a small amount of ATP, as well as several high energy electrons acceptors which it later uses to further break down the glucose.
    - As it breaks down the glucose, it uses the released energy to create a proton gradient.
    - Finally, the proton gradient diffuses through ATP synthase, creating a large amount of ATP. The bulk of the produced ATP is from the ATP synthase.
    - The ATP synthesis in the earlier steps occurs directly, without ATP synthase - **substrate-level phosphorylation**

### Mitochondria

**Mitochondria:** Organelle in which most of cellular respiration takes place

- Contains an outer membrane
- Contains an inner membrane with **cristae** - folds
- The area between the two membranes is the **intermembrane space**.
- The area inside the inner membrane is the **mitochondrial matrix**.

### Glycolysis

**Glycolysis:** First step of cellular respiration

- Takes place in the cytoplasm
- Glucose is split into two three-carbon molecules - **pyruvates**
- Consumes 2 ATP to split the glucose, produces 4 ATP with the energy released, netting 2 ATP
- Produces two **NADH high-energy electron carriers**
    - NAD+ accepts two electrons and a $H^+$ proton, creating NADH
    - The NADH are later used in the ETC
    - The high-energy electron carrier temporarily stores the energy released in glycolysis, later passing on the energy in the ETC

### Pyruvate Oxidation

**Pyruvate Oxidation:** Occurs between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle

- Takes place in the mitochondrial matrix
- Oxidizes pyruvates to **acetyl**, a two-carbon molecule
- Releases a $CO_2$ molecule
- Bonds acetyl with coenzyme-A, creating **acetyl-CoA**, which is then used in the Krebs cycle
- Creates NADH - one per pyruvate; two per glucose
- May produce ATP

### Krebs / Citric Acid Cycle

**Krebs / Citric Acid Cycle:** Completes the glucose breakdown

- Takes place in the mitochondrial matrix
- Takes acetyl-CoA
- Occurs once for each acetyl-CoA; twice in total for each glucose
- Breaks down the acetyl-CoA, releasing the two remaining carbons as two molecules of $CO_2$
- Produces some $H_2O$
- Creates ATP, NADH and FADH2
    - ATP - one per cycle; two per glucose
    - NADH - three per cycle; six per glucose
    - FADH2 - one per cycle; two per glucose
- **FADH2:** High energy electron acceptor
    - FAD accepts two electrons and two hydrogen protons, creating FADH2

### Electron Transport Chain (ETC)

**Electron Transport Chain:** Uses high-energy electron carriers to make a proton gradient

- The ETC consists of protein channels in the inner membrane
- The high-energy electron carrier NADH and FADH2s that were created during glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation and the Krebs cycle move through the ETC proteins
- The proteins use the electron carriers’ energy to pump protons from the inner membrane matrix into the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient

### ATP Synthase

**ATP Synthase:** Final ATP manufacturing step

- Finally, the proton gradient causes protons to diffuse through ATP synthase - an enzyme in the inner membrane
- Powered by the proton diffusion, the ATP synthase synthesizes ATP
- This ATP synthase is **oxidative phosphorylation**: the adding of a phosphate powered by electron that were released from an oxidation reaction
- In general, 30-38 ATP are manufactured per glucose in ATP synthase
- This is in addition to the 2 ATP from glycolysis and 2 ATP from the Krebs cycle and possible ATP from the pyruvate oxidation

### Final Electron Acceptor

Having given its energy to the ETC, the electrons are finally accepted by oxygen, which bonds with hydrogen and is released as $H_2O$

The oxygen is called the **final electron acceptor**

### Anaerobic Respiration

**Aerobic Respiration:** Cellular respiration in the presence of oxygen

- The above cellular respiratory process describes the ideal cellular respiration which occurs in the presence of oxygen
- The presence of oxygen as the final electron acceptor allows the glucose to be completely broken down

**Anaerobic Respiration:** Cellular respiration without oxygen

- Without oxygen, the cell cannot fully break down the glucose
- The only step of cellular respiration that can be done without oxygen is glycolysis
- This nets 2 ATP per glucose
- It also reduces two NAD+s to two NADHs, and produces two pyruvates.
- Instead of advancing to the Krebs cycle and the ETC, the pyruvates undergo fermentation.
- Fermentation is necessary to oxidize NADH back to NAD+, which allows glycolysis to repeat with another glucose molecule
- Animals perform **lactic acid fermentation**, converting pyruvates to lactic acid.
    - Equation:
        
        $$
        \text{Glucose} \rightarrow 2 \text{ Lactic acid} + 2 \text{ ATP}
        
        $$
        
- Plants and yeast perform **alcoholic fermentation**, converting pyruvates to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
    - Equation:
        
        $$
        \text{Glucose} \rightarrow 2 \text{ Ethanol} + 2 \text{CO}_2 + 2 \text{ ATP}
        
        $$
        
- The fermentation products are removed from the cell.
- Lactic acid is sent to the liver and may be turned back into pyruvates
- In muscle cells, lactic acid accumulation can cause muscle fatigue
