# Thermodynamics

### Energy

**Energy** is the capacity to do work. Energy is classifed as:

- **Potential Energy:** Energy stored in a system due to its location or configuration;

    - Such as gravitational potential energy of an object at height;

- **Kinetic Energy:** Energy of a moving object.

**Thermodynamics:** Study of the transfer of energy between systems

**First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy):** Energy can change forms or be transferred between systems but cannot be created or destroyed.

**Second Law of Thermodynamics:** Evey transformation of energy involves some amount of energy dissipation as heat, lowering the amount of useful ordered energy and increasing entropy

**Entropy:** Measure of disorder

### Chemical Reactions

In a **chemical reaction**, **reactants** are turned into **products.**

- **Anabolic Reaction:** Smaller molecules bond to form larger molecules

- **Catabolic Reaction:** Larger molecules decompose to smaller molecules

**Reaction Pathway**: There may be one or more **transition states** between the reactants and products. The sequence of reactants, transition states, and products is the reaction pathway.

### Energy of Chemical Reactions

**Endothermic reaction:** Reaction where the products have more energy than the reactants.

- The chemical system absorbs energy from its surroundings.

**Exothermic reaction:** Reaction where the products have less energy than the reactants.

- The chemical system releases energy to its surroundings.

A reaction's **spontenaity** depends on two factors:

- **$\Delta H$:** The change in energy

    - Systems tend to the configuration with the lowest energy; exothermic reactions are favored

- **$\Delta S$:** The change in entropy

    - Entropy tends to increase

    - The affect of entropy change is scaled by temperature; at higher temperature, there is a stronger tend to greater entorpy

**Gibbs Free Energy:** Describes the total spontenaity of a reaction by combining the affects of the changes in energy and entropy:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

- where
  
    - $\Delta G$ is the total change in Gibbs free energy;

    - $\Delta H$ is the change in energy due to exchange with surroundings;

    - $T$ is temperature; and

    - $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy.

**Exergonic Reaction:** Reaction where $\Delta G$ is negative; occurs spontaneously

- Although the actual change from reactants to products does not require energy and occurs spontaneously, the reaction still requires **activation energy** to occur

**Endergonic Reaction:** Reaction where $\Delta G$ is positive; does not occur spontaneously

**Coupled reaction:** Exergonic reaction paired with endergonic reaction

- The exergonic reaction provides energy for the endergonic reaction

# Cellular Chemical Reactions

### Metabolism

**Metabolism:** The set of chemical reactions that occur within a cell

Energy circle of life:

- Complex molecules such as sugars have greater energy than their simple components.
- A reaction that forms a complex molecule from simpler components is endergonic and absorbs energy.
- A reaction that breaks down a complex molecule to its simpler components is exogonic and releases energy.
- Plants absorb energy from the sun and use this energy to build sugars, storing the energy as chemical potential energy in the sugar's chemical bonds.
- Cells obtain this energy by breaking down the sugars.
- The released energy is stored in ATP, which the cell can readily use as a source of energy.

**Metabolic pathway:** The reaction pathway of a metabolic reaction

- **Anabolic Pathway:**
    - Builds complex molecules from simpler ones
    - Absorbs energy
- **Catabolic Pathway:**
    - Breaks complex molecules to simpler ones
    - Releases energy

Many chemical bonds in biological systems are formed through **dehydration synthesis** and broken through **hydrolysis**.

# Catalysts, Enzymes

### Catalyst

**Activation energy:** Energy required to initiate a chemical reaction
- To change from reactants to products, the reactants must first enter a **transition state**, which is less stable and has higher energy than both the reactants and products.
- The energy needed for the products to reach the transition state is the activation energy
- This is generally provided by the kinetic energy of the reactants

**Catalyst:** Substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed
- A catalysts increases the rate of a reaction by lowering the amount of activation energy needed
- The catalysts lowers the amount of activation energy needed by stabilizing the transition state

### Enzyme

**Enzyme:** Organic catalyst

- The enzyme is not consumed by the reaction, remains unchanged, and is reusable.
- Enzymes are a type of protein
- Nomenclature: Generally ends with `-ase`
    - Example: “Urease” is an enzyme that catalyzes “urea”

Components:

- The reactants bond to the enzyme, undergo the reaction, and the products are released
- **Substrate:** Term for the reactants that bond to the enzyme
- **Enzyme-substrate complex (ES):** Term for the entity formed by a substrate bonding to an enzyme
- **Active site:** The part of the enzyme the substrate bonds to
- Each enzyme is tailored for a specific chemical reaction; the active site is configured to match the substrate
    - **Induced-fit model**: Current theory stating that the active site in an enzyme does not initially fit its substrate; rather, upon initial contact with the substrate, the enzyme conformes to fit it

Generic equation for enzymatic reaction:

$$
E+S \rightarrow ES \rightarrow E+P
$$

where

- $E$ is the enzyme;
- $S$ is the substrate;
- $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex; and
- $P$ is the product.

### Inhibitors

**Inhibitor:** 

- Inhibitors are molecules that prevent an enzyme from catalyzing its reaction
- The cell uses inhibitors to control the formation of products
- Classes of inhibation:
    - **Competitive inhibition:** The inhibitor bonds to the enzyme's active site, "competing" with the substrate and using up the active site
    - **Non-competitive inhibition:** Instead of bonding to the active site, the inhibitor bonds to a different site, which causes the enzyme to change shape and no longer fit the substrate

**Allosteric Site:**

- Part of an enzyme where **allosteric effectors** bond
- Allosteric effectors are not substrate; instead, they regulate the enzyme by bonding to it and changing its shape
- Allosteric effectors can enhance the enzyme or inhibit it, as is non-competitive inhibition

**Feedback Inhibition:**

- Self-regulaotry mechanism within some metabolic pathways
- A downstream step in the pathway forms an inhibitor that inhibits an upstream step, preventing the pathway from repeating

### Factors that Affect Enzyme Function

- Enzymes have specific optimal operational conditions.
- Under non-optimal conditions, enzymatic activity decreases.
- Certain conditions can cause **denaturation**, where an enzyme loses its shape and ceases to function

Factors:

- Temperature: Enzyme effectiveness increases with increases temperature; however, excessive temperature can cause denaturation
- Concentration: Increased enzyme concentration increases reaction rate
- pH:
    - Each enzyme has an optimal range of pH
    - Most are between 6 and 8
    - pH out of the optimal range decreases enzyme function and can cause denaturation
- Presence of cofactors, coenzymes, or other enzyme modulators such as inhibitors
    - **Cofactors, Coenzymes:**
        - Increase an enzyme's activity
        - Coenzymes are organic molecules; cofactors are inorganic molecules
