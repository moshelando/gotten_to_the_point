### Scientific Method

**Science:**

- Study of the laws by which a system fundamentally operates

**Scientific method:**

- Method of studying science through observation and testing
- Scientific method steps:
    1. Observing a phenomena
    2. Posing a question
    3. Suggesting a hypothesis
    4. Making a prediction
    5. Performing an experiment
    6. Concluding a result

**Hypothesis:**

- Untested theory proposed to explain a phenomena
- Must be testable and falsifiable

**Variable:**

- A factor that can vary
    - **Independent variable:** Variable that is not affected by other factors in the experiment; directly controlled
    - **Dependent variable:** Variable that is affected by other factors in the experiment; not directly controlled

**Experiment Design:**

- Experiments consist of two groups:
    - **Control Group:**
        - Not treated with the hypothesized treatment; used for comparison
    - **Treatment Group:**
        - Treated with the hypothesized treatment
    - If a dependent variable varies between the control group and the treatment group, it can be assumed that it is dependent on the independent variable with which only the treatment group was treated

**Theory:**

- Hypothesis not rejected by experimentation

**Scientific Law / Principle:**

- Widely accepted theory

### Reasoning

**Inductive Reasoning:**

- Forming a general principle based on a specific observation

**Deductive Reasoning:**

- Deducing a specific statement from a general principle

# Biology

### Biology

**Biology:** Science of the processes by which living things live

### Life

Living entities exhibit the following characteristics:

- Order
- Energy consumption
- Growth
- Reproduction
- Response to stimuli
- Homeostasis
- Adaptation / Evolution

### Taxonomy

**Taxon:**

- Category

**Taxonomy:**

- Study of placing things into taxons
- Living entities are sorted in a multi level hierarchical system; each level contains taxons into which living entities are sorted:
    1. **Domain**
    2. **Kingdom**
    3. **Phylum**
    4. **Class**
    5. **Order**
    6. **Family**
    7. **Genus**
    8. **Species**

**Binomial Nomenclature:**

- System in which two names are used
- Biology uses a binomial nomenclature; organisms are referred to by their genus and species, in the following syntax: “*Genus species”*
    - Example: “*Homo sapiens”*; homo is the genus, sapiens is the species

**Phylogenetic Tree:**

- Diagrams the evolutionary relationship between living organisms

### Biological Components

- **Atom**:
    - Most basic building block of matter
- **Molecule:**
    - Chemically bound atoms
- **Macromolecules**:
    - Large molecule, often made of numerous smaller molecules
- **Organelle**:
    - Group of molecules within a cell performing a common function
- **Cell:**
    - Most basic building block of life; composed of molecules
- **Tissue:**
    - Group of cells performing a common function
- **Organ:**
    - Group of tissues performing a common function
- **Organ System:**
    - Group of organs performing a common function
- **Organism:**
    - Individual living entity
- **Population:**
    - All the organisms of a species within an area
- **Community:**
    - All the distinct biotic populations within an area
- **Ecosystem:**
    - System of biotic communities and the abiotic systems with which they interact within an area
- **Biosphere:**
    - All the ecosystems on earth

### Emergent Properties

**Emergent properties:**

- Properties that emerge in a complex entity that are not identifiable in the individual components that compose it.
- In biology, each level of biological components contains properties not found in the lower levels they are composed of.
