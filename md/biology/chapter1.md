### Scientific Method

**Science:**

- Study of the fundamental laws underlying a system's behavior

**Scientific method:**

- Method of practicing science based on observation and experiment
- Steps:
    - Observe a phenomena
    - Pose a query about the phenomena
    - Suggest a hypothesis which answers the question and explains the phenomena
        - The hypothesis must be testable and falsifiable; otherwise, it cannot be verified through the scientific method by surviving experimental testing.
    - Make a prediction based on the hypothesis
    - Perform an experiment to test the prediction
    - If the prediction fails, reject the hypothesis
    - If the prediction succeeds, do not reject the hyposthesis
    - **Theory:** A hypothesis that survives multiple varied experiments
    - **Principle / Scientific Law:** Theory that is accepted by the scientific community

**Experiment Design**
- An experiment has two variables:
    - **Independent variable:** Variable that is directly controlled by the experiment administrator and is not dependent on other factors within the experiment
    - **Dependent variable:** Variable that is not directly controlled by the experiment administrator and is dependent on other factors within the experiment
    - The prediction claims that a certain change in the independent variable will cause a certain result in the dependent variable
    - **Treatment group:** Group that is treated with the changed independent variable
    - **Control group:** Group that is left neutral and not treated with the changed independent variable
        - Used as a reference for the treatment group 
    - If the dependent variable varies between the treatment group and control group as predicted by the prediction, the hypothesis survives the test

### Reasoning

Classes of reasoning:
    - **Inductive Reasoning:** Formalizing a general principle from a specific instance
    - **Deductive Reasoning:** Deducing a specific instance from a general principle

# Biology

### Biology

**Biology:** Science of the processes by which living things live

### Life

Living entities exhibit the following characteristics:

- Order
- Energy consumption
- Growth
- Reproduction
- Response to stimuli
- Homeostasis
- Adaptation / Evolution

### Taxonomy

**Taxon:**

- Category

**Taxonomy:**

- Study of placing things into taxons
- Living entities are sorted in a multi level hierarchical system; each level contains taxons into which living entities are sorted:
    1. **Domain**
    2. **Kingdom**
    3. **Phylum**
    4. **Class**
    5. **Order**
    6. **Family**
    7. **Genus**
    8. **Species**

**Binomial Nomenclature:**

- System in which two names are used
- Biology uses a binomial nomenclature; organisms are referred to by their genus and species, in the following syntax: “*Genus species”*
    - Example: “*Homo sapiens”*; homo is the genus, sapiens is the species

**Phylogenetic Tree:**

- Diagrams the evolutionary relationship between living organisms

### Biological Components

- **Atom**:
    - Most basic building block of matter
- **Molecule:**
    - Chemically bound atoms
- **Macromolecules**:
    - Large molecule, often made of numerous smaller molecules
- **Organelle**:
    - Group of molecules within a cell performing a common function
- **Cell:**
    - Most basic building block of life; composed of molecules
- **Tissue:**
    - Group of cells performing a common function
- **Organ:**
    - Group of tissues performing a common function
- **Organ System:**
    - Group of organs performing a common function
- **Organism:**
    - Individual living entity
- **Population:**
    - All the organisms of a species within an area
- **Community:**
    - All the distinct biotic populations within an area
- **Ecosystem:**
    - System of biotic communities and the abiotic systems with which they interact within an area
- **Biosphere:**
    - All the ecosystems on earth

### Emergent Properties

**Emergent properties:**

- Properties that emerge in a complex entity that are not identifiable in the individual components that compose it.
- In biology, each level of biological components contains properties not found in the lower levels they are composed of.
