# Science

### Scientific Method

**Science:** Study of the fundamental laws underlying a system's behavior

**Scientific method:** Method of practicing science based on observation and experiment:

- Observe a phenomena
- Pose a query about the phenomena
- Suggest a hypothesis which answers the question and explains the phenomena
    - The hypothesis must be testable and falsifiable; otherwise, it cannot be verified through the scientific method by surviving experimental testing.
- Make a prediction based on the hypothesis
- Perform an experiment to test the prediction
- If the prediction fails, reject the hypothesis
- If the prediction succeeds, do not reject the hyposthesis
- **Theory:** A hypothesis that survives multiple varied experiments
- **Principle / Scientific Law:** Theory that is accepted by the scientific community

**Experiment Design**
- **Independent variable:** Variable that is directly controlled by the experiment administrator and is not dependent on other factors within the experiment
- **Dependent variable:** Variable that is not directly controlled by the experiment administrator and is dependent on other factors within the experiment
- The prediction claims that a certain change in the independent variable will cause a certain result in the dependent variable
- **Treatment group:** Group that is treated with the changed independent variable
- **Control group:** Group that is left neutral and not treated with the changed independent variable
    - Used as a reference for the treatment group 
- If the dependent variable varies between the treatment group and control group as predicted by the prediction, the hypothesis survives the test

### Reasoning

Classes of reasoning:
- **Inductive Reasoning:** Formalizing a general principle from a specific instance
- **Deductive Reasoning:** Deducing a specific instance from a general principle

# Biology

### Biology and Life

**Biology:** Science of living things

**Life:** While 'life' is difficult to precisely define, living things exhibit these characteristics:
    
- Order
- Energy consumption
- Growth
- Reproduction
- Homeostasis
- Response to stimuli
- Adaptation and evolution

### Taxonomy

**Taxonomy:** Science of categorizing by class

- In biology, classes are organized in a hierarchical system
- Each level has specific taxons; each level's taxons contain those of the level below
- In descending order, the levels are:
    - **Domain**
    - **Kingdom**
    - **Phylum**
    - **Class**
    - **Order**
    - **Family**
    - **Genus**
    - **Species**
- For example, the common leafcutter ant belongs to the following taxons in descending hierarchical order:
    - Eukarya > Animalia > Arthropoda > Insecta > Hymenoptera > Formicidae > Atta > cephalotes.
    - This means the leafcutter ant belongs to the domain: 'Eukarya', kingdom: 'Animalia', phylum: 'Arthropoda', class: 'Insecta', order: 'Hymenoptera', family: 'Formicidae', genus: 'Atta', and species: 'cephalotes'.

**Binomial Nomenclature:**

- Naming system that uses two names for each entity
- Biology uses a binomial nomenclature
- Organisms are named by the genus and species, as follows: “*Genus species”*
    -  Genus proceeds species
    -  Both are italicized
    -  Genus is capitalized; species is not.
-  For example, the common leafcutter ant, belonging to genus Atta and species cephalotes, is named “*Atta cephalotes”*

**Phylogenetic Tree:**

- Shows the evolutionary relationships between distinct organisms

### Hierarchical Organization of Life

The composition of living things exhibits a hierarchical organization:
- Higher levels arise from specific arrangements of lower ones
- **Emergent properties:** Properties that arise at higher levels of organization and are not identifiable in the simpler components at lower levels.

Levels:

- **Atom**: Most basic type of matter
- **Molecule:** Atoms chemically bond to form molecules
- **Macromolecules**: Large molecule, often composed of many smaller molecules
- **Organelle**: Group of molecules that collectively perform a function
- **Cell:** Most basic unit of life; composed of molecules, macromolecules, and organelle
- **Tissue:** Group of cells that collectively perform a function
- **Organ:** Group of tissues that collectively perform a function
- **Organ System:** System of organs that collectively perform a function
- **Organism:** Individual living entity
- **Population:** The set of organisms of a specific species within a specific area
- **Community:** The set of all populations within a specific area
- **Ecosystem:** The system of biotic communities and the abiotic system with which they interact within a specific area
- **Biosphere:** The system of all ecosystems on a planet
