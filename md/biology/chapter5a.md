# Chapter 5a: Cell Membrane Transport

# Cell Membrane

### Definition

**Cell membrane:** Membrane surrounding the cell

### Features

- Creates a barrier around the cell
- Controls what goes in and out of the cell
- Can change shapes
- Contains markers to identify itself to other cells
- Transmits and receives signals

### Components

**Phospholipid bilayer**

- Forms the basic membrane structure
- Phospholipids have a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail, making them **amphiphilic**
- When in water, the phospholipids form a spontaneous bilayer sheet: the hydrophilic heads turn outwards towards the water, and the hydrophobic tails turn inwards, shielded by the heads from the water
- Polar molecules cannot pass through the hydrophobic interior tails

Proteins

- Contains **integral** and **peripheral** proteins
    - **Integral:** Embedded in membrane interior; generally span entire membrane width - transmembrane
    - **Peripheral:** Attached to membrane interior or exterior surface
- Functions:
    - Transports materials in and out of cell
    - Acts as an enzyme for chemical reactions inside and outside cell
    - Recognizes other cells and extracellular material
    - Sends and receives signals
    - Attaches to other cells, cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix

Carbohydrates

- **Glycoproteins** (carbohydrates attached to proteins) and **Glycolipids** (carbohydrates attached to lipids) on exterior side
- Serve as the cell identifier; also bind to certain substances for communication and adhesion

Cholesterol

- Only in animal cells
- Embedded within the membrane, throughout the phospholipid tails
- Keeps the phospholipids from moving too close or too far from each other

### Structure

The membrane is **selectively permeable:** only certain molecules can pass through

- Only small, nonpolar molecules
- Large molecules cannot fit through; polar molecules are repelled by the hydrophobic interior

Described as a **Fluid Mosaic**

- **Mosaic:** Non uniform distribution of substances; the proteins are not evenly distributed throughout the phospholipids
- **Fluid:** The configuration is not static; rather the materials keep moving around

# Diffusion

### Definitions

**Brownian Motion:** Particles are in constant random motion

**Diffusion:** Particles’ random Brownian Motion cause them to diffuse over time from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration

**Diffusion Gradient:** Higher to lower concentration gradient

### Diffusion factors

Various factors determine diffusion rates: 

- A higher concentration gradient causes higher diffusion rates
- Higher temperatures cause higher diffusion rates
- Larger molecular size causes lower diffusion rates
- Larger molecular weight causes lower diffusion rates
- Diffusion rates also depend on the medium through which the particles are diffusing, and potential barrier permeability

# Cellular Transmembrane Diffusion, Passive Transport

### Membrane Permeability

The cell membrane is **selectively permeable**: only certain things can pass through

Large material cannot fit through

Polar or charged molecules are repelled by the hydrophobic interior

### Passive Transport

**Passive Transport:** Substances diffuse across the cell membrane *along* a concentration gradient; no cellular energy is required.

- **Simple Diffusion:** Involves small, nonpolar substances that can permeate the semipermeable cell membrane
    - Example: oxygen, carbon dioxide
- **Facilitated Diffusion:** Involves large or polar substances that cannot permeate the semipermeable cell membrane; the substances are diffused across the membrane through protein channels

### Protein Channels

**Protein Channels:** Transmembrane protein channels through which material is passively diffused

- Can selectively open and close
- **Aquaporins:** Channel proteins through which water travels
    - Note: Water transport is caused by osmosis, a specific type of diffusion

**Carrier Protein:** Bonds with a molecule on one side, changes shape, then releases it on the other side

- Used for active and passive transport

# Active Transport

### Definition

**Active Transport:** 

- Substances are transported across the membrane *against* a concentration gradient.
- Requires cellular energy, provided by ATP.
- A protein in the membrane actively transports the substance
    - **Pump:** Active transport mechanism

### Primary vs Secondary

**Primary Active Transport:**

- The transport directly facilitated by ATP energy expenditure

**Secondary Active Transport:**

- Diffuses along the concentration gradient created by the primary active transport.
- Does not directly take energy; rather, occurs due to the conditions created by the primary active transport

### Types of Active Transport Ports

**Uniport:** Specifically transports one molecule in one direction

**Symport:** Specifically transports two molecules in one direction

**Antiport:** Specifically transports two molecule is opposite directions

---

# Endocytosis, Exocytosis

### Definition

Endocytosis and Exocytosis:

- Form of bulk active transport
- A dynamic membrane forms a sac around the material and transports the material in or out of the cell

### Endocytosis

**Endocytosis:** Transports material into the cell

- The cell membrane “pinches” around material in the extracellular matrix, enclosing the material in a vesicle
- The vesicle then opens and releases the material inside the cell

**Phagocytosis:**

- Endocytosis for large molecules
- Instead of releasing the material directly into the cytoplasm, the vesicle fuses with a lysosome, which digests its contents

**Pinocytosis:**

- Endocytosis for smaller molecules
- Releases material directly into the cytoplasm

**Receptor mediated endocytosis:**

- Type of endocytosis which only occurs once the cell’s exterior protein receptor detects specific conditions

**Clathrin:**

- Prior to endocytosis, the interior side of the cell membrane is coated with a protein **clathrin**
- This enables the protein to form a vesicle

### **Exocytosis**

**Exocytosis:** Transports material out of the cell

- In the cell, material is enclosed within a vesicle
- The vesicle then fuses with the cell membrane, releasing the material into the extracellular matrix

# Osmosis

### Definition

**Osmosis:** 

- A solvent’s diffusion across a semipermeable membrane, where the solvent can pass through the membrane and the solutes cannot
- The solvent moves from the area of lower osmolarity to the area of higher osmolarity

**Osmolarity:**

- Measure of solvent’s solute concentration

### Tonicity

**Hypertonic:** 

- Area that has a higher osmolarity (solute concentration)
- Solvent flows to the hypertonic area

**Hypotonic:**

- Area that has a lower osmolarity
- Solvent flows out of the hypotonic area

**Isotonic:**

- Area that has an equal osmolarity
- Solvent does not flow in or out

---

# Cellular Transmembrane Osmosis

### Cellular Osmosis Conditions and Effects

Water diffuses in or out of a cell, depending on the tonicity of the solution the cell is in:

- **Hypertonic:**
    - Water flows *out* of the cell
    - Animal cells shrink
    - Plant cell central vacuoles shrink and detach from the cell wall; the cell becomes flaccid - **plasmolysis**
- **Hypotonic:**
    - Water flows *into* the cell
    - Animal cells burst - **lysis**
    - Plant cell central vacuoles swell, pressuring the cell wall; the cell is turgid.
- **Isotonic:**
    - Water does not flow in or out of the cell
    - Animal cells are stable
    - Plant cells lack turgidity and become somewhat flaccid
