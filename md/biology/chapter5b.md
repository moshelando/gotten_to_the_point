# Thermodynamics

### Energy

**Energy:** The capacity to do work

- **Potential Energy:** Stored energy
    - Such as gravitational, chemical, electrical
- **Kinetic Energy:** Energy of motion

### Thermodynamic Laws and Terms

**Thermodynamics:** The study of energy transfer and heat

**First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy):** Energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be destroyed or created

**Second Law of Thermodynamics:** During every transformation of energy, some energy is dissipated as heat and rendered useless; systems tend towards entropy

**Entropy:** Level of disorder in a system

# Chemical Reactions

### Chemical Reactions

In a **chemical reaction**, **reactants** are turned into **products.**

- **Anabolic Reaction:** smaller molecules are bonded to form larger molecules
- **Catabolic** **Reaction:** larger molecules are broken into smaller molecules

There may be numerous **transition state** steps between the reactants and the final product.

### Energy Input and Output

It takes energy to bond molecules. The energy is then stored in the bond as **potential chemical energy.** When the bond is broken, the energy is released.

**Endergonic Reaction:** Reaction in which energy enters the system

- An endergonic reaction cannot occur without external energy input

**Exergonic Reaction:** Reaction in which energy exits the system

- Since the reaction does not require external energy, it happens **spontaneously**, meaning, without an external energy input
    - Note: Although the reaction itself does not take energy, it does require energy in order to be activated - **activation energy**

**Coupled reaction:** Exergonic reaction paired with endergonic reaction; the exergonic reaction provides the energy for the endergonic reaction

### Gibbs Free Energy

Reaction Spontaneity:

- If the level of energy within a system after a reaction is *higher* than the level of energy before the reaction, the reaction requires energy input, and will not happen spontaneously.
- If the level of energy within a system after a reaction is *lower* than the level of energy before the reaction, the reaction does not require energy input, and will happen spontaneously.
- “Energy” is this context specifically refers to **free energy** - usable energy. Due to entropy, a portion of energy is unusable, and does not contribute towards the energy calculated for the reaction.

**Gibbs Free Energy:**

- Formula for calculating free energy:
    
    $$
    G=H-TS
    $$
    
    where
    
    - $G$ refers to the level of Gibbs Free Energy;
    - $H$ refers to the total level of thermodynamic energy;
    - $T$ refers to the temperature; and
    - $S$ refers to the level of entropy.
- Entropy is multiplied by temperature because temperature scales the magnitude of entropy’s effect on energy usefulness.

# Cellular Chemical Reactions

### Metabolism

Cells require energy

Energy circle of life:

- Plants get energy from the sun and store the energy in sugars.
- Animals digest the sugars and store the energy in ATP
- When energy is needed, the energy is quickly released from the ATP.

**Metabolism:** The totality of all the chemical reactions within a cell

**Metabolic pathway:** The series of reaction reactants undergo from the reactant state through the transition state to the product state

- **Anabolic Pathway:**
    - Bonds are formed
    - Energy is required
- **Catabolic Pathway:**
    - Bonds are broken
    - Energy is released

In general, biological bonds are formed through **dehydration synthesis** and are broken through **hydrolysis**.

# Catalysts, Enzymes

### Catalyst

**Activation energy:** Amount of energy needed to start a chemical reaction

**Catalyst:** Substance that speeds up a reaction by reducing the amount of necessary activation energy

### Enzyme

**Enzyme:** Organic catalyst

- The enzyme is not consumed by the reaction, remains unchanged, and is reusable.
- Enzymes are generally protein
- Nomenclature: Generally end with `-ase`
    - Example: “Urease” is an enzyme that catalyzes “urea”

Components:

- **Substrate:** Reactants of the reaction the enzyme is catalyzing
- **Product:** Product of the reaction
- The substrate bonds with the enzyme’s **active site**, creating an **enzyme-substrate complex (ES)**.
- Each enzyme is tailored for a specific chemical reaction; the shape of the enzyme’s active site matches the shape of the substrates.
    - **Induced-Fit Model:**
        - Current theory about the how the active site first the substrate:
        - The active site is not initially a perfect fit, but, upon contact from the substrate, the enzyme slightly changes shape to snug the substrate

Enzymatic reaction formula:

$$
E+S \rightarrow ES \rightarrow E+P
$$

where

- $E$ refers to the enzyme;
- $S$ refers to the substrate;
- $ES$ refers to the enzyme-substrate complex; and
- $P$ refers to the product.

### Inhibitors

**Inhibitor:** 

- Molecule that inhibits an enzyme from facilitating its reaction
    - **Competitive Inhibition:** A non-substrate molecules inhibits the enzyme by bonding with the active site, “competing” with the substrate and taking its spot
    - **Non-Competitive Inhibition:** A molecule inhibits the enzyme by bonding to it - generally to an allosteric site, not the activation site - and causing it to change its active site’s shape and no longer fit the substrate

**Allosteric Site:**

- Area on enzyme where non-substrate molecules can bond
- Can enhance or inhibit the enzyme’s functionality by changing its shape

**Feedback Inhibition:**

- Self regulatory process within a metabolic pathway
- A later step in the pathway creates an inhibitor which inhibits the enzyme from an earlier step, preventing the pathway from repeating

### Factors of Enzyme Functionality

Enzymes have optimal operational conditions.

Under non-optimal conditions, enzymatic activity decreases.

Certain conditions can cause **denaturation** - ****an enzyme losing its shape and no longer functioning.

- Temperature Effect: Enzyme activity increases as temperature increases, however, an excessively high temperature can cause denaturation.
- Concentration Effect: Higher enzyme concentration causes higher enzymatic activity.
- pH Effect: Each enzyme has an optimal pH range; most are between 6 and 8. Higher or lower pH levels will decrease enzymatic activity and may cause denaturation.
- Presence of cofactors and coenzymes

**Cofactors, Coenzymes:**

- Molecules which assist an enzyme in catalyzing a reaction
- Cofactors are non-organic; coenzymes are organic.
