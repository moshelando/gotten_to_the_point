# Thermodynamics

### Energy

**Energy** is the capacity to do work. Energy is classifed as:

- **Potential Energy:** Energy stored in a system due to its location or configuration;
    - Such as gravitational potential energy for an object at height;
- **Kinetic Energy:** Energy of a moving object.

**Thermodynamics:** Study of the transfer of energy between systems

**First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy):** Energy can change forms or be transferred between systems but cannot be created or destroyed.

**Second Law of Thermodynamics:** Evey transformation of energy involves some amount of energy dissipation as heat, lowering the amount of useful ordered energy and increasing entropy

**Entropy:** Measure of disorder

### Chemical Reactions

In a **chemical reaction**, **reactants** are turned into **products.**

- **Anabolic Reaction:** Smaller molecules bond to form larger molecules
- **Catabolic Reaction:** Larger molecules decompose to smaller molecules

**Reaction Pathway**: There may be one or more **transition states** between the reactants and products. The total path of reactants, transition states, and products is the reaction pathway.

### Energy of Chemical Reactions

**Endothermic reaction:** Reaction where the products have more energy than the reactants.
- The chemical system absorbs energy from its surroundings.
**Exothermic reaction:** Reaction where the products have less energy than the reactants.
- The chemical system releases energy to its surroundings.

A reaction's **spontenaity** depends two factors:
- **$\Delta H$:** The change in energy
    - Systems tend to the configuration with the lowest energy; exothermic reactions are favored
- **$\Delta S$:** The change in entropy
    - Entropy tends to increase
    - The affect of entropy change is scaled by temperature; at higher temperature, there is a stronger tend to greater energy

**Gibbs Free Energy:** Describes the total spontenaity of a reaction by comparing the affects of the changes in energy and entropy:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

- where
  
    - $\Delta G$ is the total change in Gibbs free energy;
    - $\Delta H$ is the change in energy due to exchange with surroundings;
    - $T$ is temperature; and
    - $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy.

**Exergonic Reaction:** Reaction where $\Delta G$ is negative; occurs spontaneously
- Although the actual change from reactants to products does not require energy and occurs spontaneously, the reaction still requires **activation energy** to occur
**Endergonic Reaction:** Reaction where $\Delta G$ is positive; does not occur spontaneously

**Coupled reaction:** Exergonic reaction paired with endergonic reaction
- The exergonic reaction provides energy for the endergonic reaction

# Cellular Chemical Reactions

### Metabolism

**Metabolism:** The set of chemical reactions that occur within a cell

Energy circle of life:

- Complex molecules such as sugars have greater energy than their simple components.
- A reaction that forms a complex molecule from simpler components is endergonic and absorbs energy.
- A reaction that breaks down a complex molecule to its simpler components is exogonic and releases energy.
- Plants absorb energy from the sun and use this energy to build sugars, storing the energy as chemical potential energy in the sugar's chemical bonds.
- Cells obtain this energy by breaking down the sugars.
- The released energy is stored in ATP, which the cell can readily use as a source of energy.

**Metabolic pathway:** The reaction pathway of a metabolic reaction

- **Anabolic Pathway:**
    - Builds complex molecules from simpler ones
    - Absorbs energy
- **Catabolic Pathway:**
    - Breaks complex molecules to simpler ones
    - Releases energy

Many chemical bonds in biological systems are formed through **dehydration synthesis** and broken through **hydrolysis**.

# Catalysts, Enzymes

### Catalyst

**Activation energy:** Amount of energy needed to start a chemical reaction

**Catalyst:** Substance that speeds up a reaction by reducing the amount of necessary activation energy

### Enzyme

**Enzyme:** Organic catalyst

- The enzyme is not consumed by the reaction, remains unchanged, and is reusable.
- Enzymes are generally protein
- Nomenclature: Generally end with `-ase`
    - Example: “Urease” is an enzyme that catalyzes “urea”

Components:

- **Substrate:** Reactants of the reaction the enzyme is catalyzing
- **Product:** Product of the reaction
- The substrate bonds with the enzyme’s **active site**, creating an **enzyme-substrate complex (ES)**.
- Each enzyme is tailored for a specific chemical reaction; the shape of the enzyme’s active site matches the shape of the substrates.
    - **Induced-Fit Model:**
        - Current theory about the how the active site first the substrate:
        - The active site is not initially a perfect fit, but, upon contact from the substrate, the enzyme slightly changes shape to snug the substrate

Enzymatic reaction formula:

$$
E+S \rightarrow ES \rightarrow E+P
$$

where

- $E$ refers to the enzyme;
- $S$ refers to the substrate;
- $ES$ refers to the enzyme-substrate complex; and
- $P$ refers to the product.

### Inhibitors

**Inhibitor:** 

- Molecule that inhibits an enzyme from facilitating its reaction
    - **Competitive Inhibition:** A non-substrate molecules inhibits the enzyme by bonding with the active site, “competing” with the substrate and taking its spot
    - **Non-Competitive Inhibition:** A molecule inhibits the enzyme by bonding to it - generally to an allosteric site, not the activation site - and causing it to change its active site’s shape and no longer fit the substrate

**Allosteric Site:**

- Area on enzyme where non-substrate molecules can bond
- Can enhance or inhibit the enzyme’s functionality by changing its shape

**Feedback Inhibition:**

- Self regulatory process within a metabolic pathway
- A later step in the pathway creates an inhibitor which inhibits the enzyme from an earlier step, preventing the pathway from repeating

### Factors of Enzyme Functionality

Enzymes have optimal operational conditions.

Under non-optimal conditions, enzymatic activity decreases.

Certain conditions can cause **denaturation** - an enzyme losing its shape and no longer functioning.

- Temperature Effect: Enzyme activity increases as temperature increases, however, an excessively high temperature can cause denaturation.
- Concentration Effect: Higher enzyme concentration causes higher enzymatic activity.
- pH Effect: Each enzyme has an optimal pH range; most are between 6 and 8. Higher or lower pH levels will decrease enzymatic activity and may cause denaturation.
- Presence of cofactors and coenzymes

**Cofactors, Coenzymes:**

- Molecules which assist an enzyme in catalyzing a reaction
- Cofactors are non-organic; coenzymes are organic.
