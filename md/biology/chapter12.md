# Chapter 12: Ecology, Communities and the Environment

# Ecology

### Ecology

**Ecology:**

- Study of the interactions between organisms and their environment

### Levels of Ecology

**Level of ecology:**

- **Organism:**
    - Individual living entity
- **Population:**
    - All the organisms of a species within an area
- **Community:**
    - All the distinct populations within an area
- **Ecosystem:**
    - System of communities and the abiotic systems with which they interact
- **Biosphere:**
    - All the ecosystems on earth

# Habitat, Niche

### **Habitat**

**Habitat:**

- Area where an organism lives

### Niche

**Niche:**

- An organism’s “place” within its environment
    - Includes all the ways the organism interacts with its environment - where it lives, what it eats, its role within its ecosystem, etc.

**Competitive exclusion principle:**

- Two species cannot occupy the same niche; one will inevitably outcompete the other

**Niche Partitioning:**

- Two species coexisting in a niche by partitioning the niche
    - Example: Two species of birds occupying different parts of a tree

# Interactions

### Competition

Organisms in an ecosystem compete for resources - such as food, space, mates

**Intraspecific Competition:**

- Competition within a species

**Interspecific Competition:**

- Competition between two distinct species

### Predation

**Predators** eat **prey**.

### Symbiosis

**Symbiotic Relationship:**

- Extended interactive relationship between different species
- **Mutualism:**
    - Both organisms benefit
        - Example: sea anemone and clown fish
- **Commensalism:**
    - One organism benefits and the other is unaffected
        - Example: whale and barnacle
- **Parasitism:**
    - One organism benefits and the other is harmed
        - Example: dog and flea

# Food Chain

### Organic Material

Organisms obtain energy by consuming organic material.

The organic material needs to be synthesized from inorganic material.

### Trophic Categories

**Autotroph:**

- Organism that synthesizes its own organic material
- **Photosynthesis:**
    - Process by which plants synthesize organic material using sunlight
- **Chemosynthesis:**
    - Process by which select organisms synthesize organic material using energy obtained from oxidative reactions

**Heterotroph (Consumer):**

- Organism that obtains organic material by consuming other organisms

### Types of Consumers

**Consumer:**

- Organism that obtains organic molecules by consuming other organisms

Types of consumers:

- **Herbivore:**
    - Eats plants
- **Carnivore:**
    - Eats animals
- **Omnivore:**
    - Eats both plants and animals
- **Detritivore:**
    - Eats dead organisms
- **Decomposer:**
    - Secretes enzymes that decompose organic material back into inorganic material
    - Includes bacteria, fungi

### Food Chain

**Food Chain:**

- Linear representation of the progression of food, from the organism that synthesizes it, up to the organism that eats it, etc.

**Food Web:**

- Non-linear representation of the food progression; takes into account that organisms may eat others on their level, or others more than one level below, etc.
- More complex than a food chain; generally more realistic

**Trophic Level:**

- An organism’s level within a food chain
    - **Producer:**
        - Bottommost, autotroph
    - **Primary Consumer:**
        - Eats the producer
        - `$1\degree$`
    - **Secondary Consumer:**
        - Eats the primary consumer
        - `$2\degree$`
    - **Tertiary Consumer:**
        - Eats the secondary consumer
        - `$3\degree$`
    - **Quaternary Consumer:**
        - Eats the tertiary consumer
        - `$4\degree$`
- In a food web, an organism can have multiple trophic levels; for example, it can be both a primary and secondary consumer

### Food Chain Pyramids

**Food Chain Pyramid:**

- Demonstrates a variables variation at each trophic level
- **Food Chain Energy Pyramid:**
    - The food chain’s energy pyramid is always largest at the bottom and smaller as it goes up
    - Each trophic level has less energy than the previous level
    - Each transformation of energy between levels loses energy to entropy
- Other food chain pyramids include **pyramid of numbers** - demonstrating the number of organisms at each level, and **pyramid of biomass** - demonstrating the total biomass at each level.
- The pyramid of biomass is typically largest on bottom and smaller as it goes up, however, the pyramid of numbers can assume varied shapes.

# Abiotic Cycles

### Abiotic Resources

**Abiotic** - non living - **resources**, such as water and nutrients, are finite.

Essential elements are cycled between biotic and abiotic states.

### Water Cycle

In the **water cycle**, water cycles between the **atmosphere** and the **geosphere:**

- **Precipitation:**
    - Water falls from clouds as rain or snow
- **Evaporation:**
    - Open water evaporates into the atmosphere
- **Transpiration:**
    - Water in leaves evaporates into the atmosphere
- **Condensation:**
    - Water in the atmosphere condenses into clouds

### Carbon Cycle

- Atmospheric $CO_2$ is absorbed by plants during **photosynthesis**
- $CO_2$ is released into the atmosphere by:
    - **Decomposition**
    - **Respiration**
    - **Burning fossil fuels** such as coal, oil and gasoline

### Nitrogen Cycle

- Atmospheric nitrogen is not directly usable
- **Nitrogen Fixation:**
    - Various bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to a usable form
- **Assimilation:**
    - Plants absorb nitrate from the soil
    - Other organisms obtain nitrogen by eating plants, etc.
- **Decomposition:**
    - Biotic organisms die, decompose, and the nitrogen is returned to the soil
- Decomposed nitrogen can be recycled, or **denitrified** by bacteria and returned to the atmosphere.

### Phosphorous Cycle

- Phosphorous is needed for ATP, DNA, RNA, phospholipids, bones, and other organs.
- The phosphorous cycle does not have a gaseous phase, and takes much longer than other cycles.
