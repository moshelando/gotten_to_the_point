# DNA, Ribosomes

### Central Dogma of Life

The **central dogma of life** describes the process of cellular information:

- DNA stores the genetic information
- **Transcription:** DNA information is transcribed to RNA
- **Translation:** RNA information is translated as a specific protein formation
- The specific proteins perform a specific function, carrying out the DNA’s information

### Nucleus

**Nucleus:**

- Only in eukaryotes
- Stores the DNA
- Referred to as the “control center of the cell”
- Components:
    - **DNA**
    - **Nucleolus:** Dark area where rRNA and ribosome are constructed
    - **Nuclear Envelope:** Double membrane that surrounds the nucleus
        - Contains pores for molecules to enter and exit
        - Filled with nucleoplasm

### **DNA**

- Prokaryotes have a single circular DNA chromosome, located in the nucleoid region
    - They may also have **plasmids:** smaller circular DNA separate from the main strand
- Eukaryotes have multiple linear DNA chromosome, located in the nucleus
    - Eukaryotic DNA is packed into a DNA-protein complex named **chromatin**
- DNA information is **transcribed** to mRNA (messenger RNA). In eukaryotes, this happens in the nucleus. The mRNA is then translated to protein in the ribosome.

### Ribosomes

**Ribosome:**

- Synthesize proteins from amino acids
- Composed of rRNA and protein

Protein synthesis:

- tRNA (transfer RNA) transfers amino acids to the ribosome
- The ribosome synthesizes the amino acids to protein based on the mRNA instructions

Structure:

- Unlike other organelle, ribosome are not membrane bound
- Contains two parts; a large and a small subunit
    - In protein synthesis, the mRNA is threaded between the large and small subunits
    - The small subunit translates the mRNA
    - The amino acids are arranged and bonded in the large subunit

Location:

- Can be free in the cytoplasm, attached to the cell membrane, nuclear envelope or RER
- Free ribosome generally synthesize protein that will remain in the cytoplasm; RER ribosome generally synthesize protein that will leave the cell or be embedded in the cell membrane.

**Polyribosome**: Cluster of multiple ribosome

# Mitochondria, Chloroplasts

### Mitochondria

**Mitochondria:**

- Only in eukaryotes
- Performs cellular respiration; manufactures ATP
- Referred to as the “powerhouse of the cell”

Structure:

- Contains an outer membrane
- Contains an inner membrane with **cristae** - folds
- The area in between the two membranes is the **intermembrane space**.
- The area inside the inner membrane is the **mitochondrial matrix**.

### Chloroplasts

**Chloroplasts:**

- Only in plant cells
    - Only in green parts of plants; not in, for example, the edible part on an onion
- Perform photosynthesis

Structure:

- Contains a double outer membrane
- **Thylakoids:** Disc-like structures within the chloroplast
    - **Chlorophyll:** Pigments within the thylakoid membrane; absorb sunlight
        - Does not absorb green wavelength sunlight, instead reflecting it, resulting in a green appearance
    - **Thylakoid lumen:** Within the thylakoid membrane
- **Granum** (plural: grana)**:** Stack of thylakoids
- **Stroma:** Space inside chloroplast not occupied by thylakoids, filled with fluid
- Some bacteria can perform photosynthesis. They have thylakoids with chlorophyll, but do not have chloroplasts.

### Endosymbiosis Theory

**Endosymbiosis Theory:**

- Theorizes that mitochondria and chloroplasts were originally independent prokaryotic cells that later became integrated into eukaryotes in a symbiotic relationship
- Indicated by the following features found in both mitochondria and chloroplasts:
    - Double membrane
    - Contain their own DNA and ribosomes
    - Can reproduce independently

# Endomembrane System

### **Overview**

- Only in eukaryotes
- System of organelles that modify, package and transport proteins, carbohydrates and lipids
- Generally, the endomembrane system specifically handles molecules that are bound to leave the cell or be embedded in the cell membrane
- Endomembrane organelle are membrane-bound and have interior lumen with separate conditions from the cytoplasm, specific for their functions.
- Materials are transported between endomembrane organelle in transport vesicles

### **Endoplasmic Reticulum**

**Endoplasmic Reticulum:**

- Interconnected membrane that extends from the nuclear envelope’s outer membrane
- Has two parts: Rough ER and Smooth ER
- **Rough ER:**
    - Studded with ribosomes
    - Modifies protein and phospholipids
- **Smooth ER:**
    - Does not have ribosome
    - Modifies lipids and cholesterol; performs select detoxification; stores calcium

### Golgi Apparatus

**Golgi Apparatus:**

- Set of non-connected membrane discs
- Packages, labels and ships proteins
- Has two sides:
    - **Cis side:** faces the ER
    - **Trans side:** faces away from the ER

### Vesicles

**Vesicles:**

- Dynamic membrane sac, used to transfer material
- Formed from the ER and Golgi membrane; sacs bud off a departure point with material inside, then fuse to the arrival point and release their material

### Lysosome

**Lysosome:**

- Only in animals, not plants
- Vesicle containing digestive enzymes
- Fuses with other vesicles and digests their contents
- Breaks down old organelle, foreign agents; involved in cell suicide

# Vacuoles, Peroxisomes

### Vacuoles

**Vacuole:**

- Only in eukaryotes
- Permanent membrane bound sac; usually used for storage

### Central Vacuole

**Central Vacuole:**

- Only in plant cells
- Large, fluid filled central vacuole
- Function: structure, storage, digestion, maintaining chemical balance
- Supports cell structure by swelling with fluid and providing turgor pressure against the cell wall

### Peroxisomes

**Peroxisome:**

- Only in eukaryotes
- Small membrane bound organelle; detoxifies and breaks down molecules through oxidation
- **Glyoxysomes:** Special peroxisomes in plants that convert fat to sugars.

# Cytoplasm

### Cytoplasm

**Cytoplasm:**

- Area within the cell membrane (excluding the nucleus in eukaryotes)
- Filled with cytosol, a jelly-like substance

    - Plants’ cell wall and central vacuole conjunctively maintain rigidity, support, strength and structure.
- **Chitin:** Composes fungi’s cell wall
- **Peptidoglycan:** Composes bacterias’ cell wall
- **Capsule:** Some bacteria are further surrounded by a capsule
- **Flagella:** Present in some cells: tail-like propeller by which the cell moves
- **Cilia:** Present in some eukaryotes: short, hairish protrusions which can move the cell or move substances along the cell surface.
    - In eukaryotes, cilia and flagella are made of microtubules arranged in a 9+2 structure: 2 central microtubules surrounded by 9 outer microtubule doublets
- **Pili:** Present in some bacteria: thin cell-membrane protrusions
    - Aid in adhesion to surfaces and in transferring genetic material.

### Extracellular Activity

**Plants:**

- Plant cell membranes are surrounded by a rigid cellulose wall
- Neighboring cell walls are connected
- Neighboring cells communicate and transfer material through plasmodesmata connections
- **Plasmodesmata:**
    - “Tunnel” between two plant cells
    - Goes through the wall between the two cells and connects their cytoplasm
- **Animals:**
    - **Extracellular Matrix (ECM):** Area between cells
        - Filled with various proteins, mostly **collagen**
        - Holds cells in place; facilitates communication between cells
        - Binds with **integrin** proteins on the cell membrane surface
        - Facilitates intercellular communication; substances in the matrix can send signals to the cell through the integrin
    - Animal cells have three types of junctions:
        - **Gap junction:**
            - Similar to plasmodesmata - protein tunnel from one cell’s cytoplasm to its neighbor’s
        - **Tight junction:**
            - Fuses the surface of neighboring cells together
            - Proteins in the two cell membranes bond
            - Prevents things from passing between the cells; creates a waterproof barrier
        - **Desmosomes:**
            - Protrusions from the cell that latch to desmosomes of the adjacent cell
            - Attaches the two cells, but not tightly
